            <h1><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h1>
            <p>Last Revised On: April 15, 2022</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy describes Perchtax&#x27;s policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information. Perchtax receives your information through our Perchtax website https://perchtax.com, APIs, services and third parties (&quot;Services&quot;). When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country that you reside in or create information from, your information may be used by Perchtax in the United States or any other country where Perchtax operates.</p>
            <h2><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></h2>
            <p><em>We collect and use your information to provide our Services and improve them over time.</em></p>
            <p><strong>Information Collected Upon Registration:</strong> When you create or modify an Perchtax account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, email address, and password. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with the Service, improving the content of the Service, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features.</p>
            <p><strong>Information Collected Automatically:</strong> When you use the Service, Perchtax automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser or mobile platform, including your location, IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. We treat this data as non-Identifying Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. Perchtax only uses this data in aggregate form. We may provide aggregate information to our partners about how Perchtax Users, collectively, use our Service, so that our partners may also understand how often people use their services and our Service.</p>
            <p>We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Perchtax Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Services are being used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.</p>
            <p>We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Perchtax newsletters, marketing materials, and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your &quot;user profile&quot; information. Please note that we may also use your Personal Information to contact you with information related to your use of the Service; you may not opt out of these notifications.</p>
            <h3><strong>Log Data</strong></h3>
            <p>When you visit the Service, whether as a Perchtax User or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a &quot;Perchtax User&quot;), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (&quot;Log Data&quot;). This Log Data may include information such as your computer&#x27;s Internet Protocol (&quot;IP&quot;) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Service, pages of our Service that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Service, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Service and for the Service&#x27;s technical administration, to increase our Service&#x27;s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors&#x27; needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.</p>
            <h3><strong>Cookies</strong></h3>
            <p>Like many websites, we use &quot;cookies&quot; to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer&#x27;s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage by Perchtax Users and web traffic routing on the Service. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Service and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Service may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Service.</p>
            <p>Web Beacons</p>
            <p>Our Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our Service is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.</p>
            <h3><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong></h3>
            <p><em>We do not disclose your private information except in the limited circumstances described here.</em></p>
            <p>Information you enter into Perchtax will be accessible by other users on your team, unless you mark information as Private or Public.</p>
            <p>Information marked Private will be accessible by anyone you invite to view and edit your information. Information marked as Public is accessible by anyone, and could be included in search engines such as Google.</p>
            <h3><strong>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER</strong></h3>
            <p>YOUR INFORMATION MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO - AND MAINTAINED ON - COMPUTERS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF YOUR STATE, PROVINCE, COUNTRY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL JURISDICTION WHERE THE PRIVACY LAWS MAY NOT BE AS PROTECTIVE AS THOSE IN YOUR JURISDICTION. IF YOU ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND CHOOSE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO US, TALKTO TRANSFERS PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES AND PROCESSES IT THERE. YOUR CONSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY FOLLOWED BY YOUR SUBMISSION OF SUCH INFORMATION REPRESENTS YOUR AGREEMENT TO THAT TRANSFER.</p>
            <h3><strong>Phishing</strong></h3>
            <p>Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft and phishing is a top priority. Perchtax will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission&#x27;s website at http://www.ftc.gov.</p>
            <h3><strong>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information</strong></h3>
            <p>We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.</p>
            <h3><strong>Third Party Services</strong></h3>
            <p>Perchtax uses a variety of services hosted by third parties to help provide our Services, such as hosting our blog, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics, Drift, Sentry and Fullstory. These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP request.</p>
            <p>Perchtax will also share or disclose your information with your consent, such as when you use a third party client to access the Perchtax Services.</p>
            <h3><strong>Law and Harm</strong></h3>
            <p>We may disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Perchtax&#x27;s rights or property.</p>
            <h3><strong>Business Transfers</strong></h3>
            <p>In the event that Perchtax is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this privacy policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.</p>
            <h3><strong>Modifying Your Personal Information</strong></h3>
            <p>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools to access or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account. Even after you delete your account or profile, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere, to the extent it has been shared with others.</p>
            <h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>
            <p>Your Perchtax account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately, and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>
            <p>Perchtax cannot, however, guarantee the security of user account information. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure; and, unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>
            <h3><strong>Links to Other Services</strong></h3>
            <p>Our Service contains links to other websites. If you choose to visit another website advertiser by &quot;clicking on&quot; a third party link, you will be directed to that third party&#x27;s website. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other Services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them.</p>
            <h3><strong>Logging In with Google</strong></h3>
            <p>You can log in to our Service using Google. This service will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name, email address, and picture to pre-populate your profile.</p>
            <h3><strong>Not For Children</strong></h3>
            <p>None of our websites, applications or services are intended for children. Please do not submit information about yourself using our websites if you are under 13.</p>
            <p>Perchtax does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at legal@perchtax.com. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will take steps to delete such information and terminate the child’s account.</p>

            <h2>What’s a Rich Text element?</h2>
            <p>The rich text element allows you to create and format headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, images, and video all in one place instead of having to add and format them individually. Just double-click and easily create content.</p>
            <h4>Static and dynamic content editing</h4>
            <p>A rich text element can be used with static or dynamic content. For static content, just drop it into any page and begin editing. For dynamic content, add a rich text field to any collection and then connect a rich text element to that field in the settings panel. Voila!</p>
            <h4>How to customize formatting for each rich text</h4>
            <p>Headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, figures, images, and figure captions can all be styled after a class is added to the rich text element using the &quot;When inside of&quot; nested selector system.</p>

This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Tallyfor, in the manner permitted by the Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, an assignment of use of the software for the Services, includes but is not limited to, use of the Services through your account to make use of the Services outside of the ordinary course of your business as disclosed to us by you and directly conducted by you. In the case of a business entity, a change in control of such business entity (as determined by Tallyfor in its sole discretion which shall generally, but need not, be based on a change in majority ownership of such business entity or change in management of such business entity as to place it under the control of another, in each case as in existence on the date provision of the Services first commences) is considered to effect an impermissible assignment and shall result in termination of the Services and closing of your account. You agree to immediately notify Tallyfor of any such change in ownership or management. </p>
            <p>10.2 You may not (and you may not permit anyone else to) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decipher, disassemble, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the Software or any part thereof, unless this is expressly permitted or required by law, or unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by the Chief Executive Officer of Tallyfor, in writing.</p>
            <p>10.3 Unless you have been specifically permitted to do so in a separate written agreement between you and the Chief Executive Officer of Tallyfor, you agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade or resell the Software for any purpose.</p>
            <p>10.4 Unless the Chief Executive Officer of Tallyfor has given you specific written permission to do so, you may not assign (or grant a sub-license of) your rights to use the Software, grant a security interest in or over your rights to use the Software, or otherwise transfer any part of your rights to use the Software.</p>
            <h3><strong>11. Third-Party Sites; Other Users</strong></h3>
            <p>11.1 Account Information from Third Party Sites.

            <p>11.3 Third-Party Links. The Service may contain links to third-party websites and services, and offer integrations or connections with third-party applications, including accounting and cloud storage applications (collectively, “Third-Party Links”). Such Third-Party Links are not under the control of Company, and Company is not responsible for any Third-Party Links. Company provides access to these Third-Party Links only as a convenience to you, and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third-Party Links. You use all Third-Party Links at your own risk, and should apply a suitable level of caution and discretion in doing so. When you click on any of the Third-Party Links, the applicable third party’s terms and policies apply, including the third party’s privacy and data gathering practices. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such Third-Party Links.</p>
            <p>11.4 Other Users. Each Service user is solely responsible for any and all of its own Customer Data. Because we do not control Customer Data, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any Customer Data, whether provided by you or by others. We make no guarantees regarding the accuracy, currency, suitability, or quality of any Customer Data. Your interactions with other Service users are solely between you and such users. You agree that Company will not be responsible for any loss or damage incurred as the result of any such interactions. If there is a dispute between you and any Service user, we are under no obligation to become involved, but reserve the right to investigate (and you agree to cooperate in any such investigation) and to take any action we feel is appropriate, including closing your account and terminating your access to the Services without advance notice. </p>
            <p>11.5 Release. You hereby release and forever discharge the Company (and our officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns) from, and hereby waive and relinquish, each and every past, present and future dispute, claim, controversy, demand, right, obligation, liability, action and cause of action of every kind and nature (including personal injuries, death, and property damage), that has arisen or arises directly or indirectly out of, or that relates directly or indirectly to, the Service (including any interactions with, or act or omission of, other Service users or any Third-Party Links). IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU HEREBY WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542 IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, WHICH STATES: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY.”</p>
            <h3><strong>12. Software updates</strong></h3>
            <p>12.1 The Software which you use may automatically download and install updates from time to time from Tallyfor.

You agree to receive such updates (and permit Tallyfor to deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Services.</p>
            <h3><strong>13. Payments and Billing</strong></h3>
            <p>13.1 Fees. You will pay all fees agreed to at time of subscription.

All fees are billed in advance and are based on subscriptions purchased. Fees paid are non-refundable and payment obligations cannot be cancelled. Fees are based on the product offering at time of purchase and are not contingent on the delivery of future functionality. We may suspend our services to you until unpaid fees are paid in full, without limiting our other rights and remedies. You also agree to pay increases to fees and recurring charges as such may occur from time-to-time.</p>
            <p>13.2 Recurring Charges. Some of the paid services may involve a recurring payment plan, where charges automatically recur on a monthly, annual or other regular basis. By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges you incur prior to receipt of your cancellation notice being acknowledged and accepted by Tallyfor. You accept that Tallyfor may charge you according to the terms of the recurring payment plan without further authorization from you, until (i) you provide notice to Tallyfor according to the means Tallyfor has implemented for receipt of such notice and (ii) receive confirmation of our receipt of said notice that you have terminated this authorization.</p>
            <p>13.3 Invoicing and Payment. You must provide current, complete and accurate information for your billing account. You must keep all billing information current, complete and accurate, and must promptly notify us and your payment processor if your payment method is cancelled or if you become aware of a potential breach of security. If you fail to provide current, complete and accurate billing information, you agree that we may continue charging you for any use of paid services under your billing account unless you have terminated your paid services as described above. When Tallyfor chooses to bill through an invoice, then full payment for invoices issued in any given month must be received by Tallyfor no more than thirty (30) days after the mailing date (or transmission date if sent electronically) of the invoice.  Unpaid amounts are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection and may result in immediate termination of your use of the Services. You agree to be responsible for all taxes associated with the Services other than taxes legally required to be borne by the Company.</p>
            <p>13.4 Third-Party Payment Processor. We may use a third-party payment processor to bill you through a payment account linked to your account on Tallyfor for use of the paid services. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms and privacy policies of the payment processor in addition to these Terms of Service. We are not responsible for any errors by the payment processor.</p>
            <h3><strong>14. Protection Measures</strong></h3>
            <p>14.1 Staff Confidentiality. We agree that all Tallyfor staff who have access to and/or process Customer Personal Data will be obliged to keep the Customer Personal Data confidential.</p>
            <p>14.2 Technical and Organizational Measures. We will ensure that any third parties we contract with have in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that Customer Personal Data, made available to them as part of providing the Services, is subject to an appropriate level of security, including to the extent required the measures referred to in Article 32(1) of the GDPR. In reaching our judgement as to the appropriate level of security we will take into account current technology, costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing undertaken as well as the harm that might result from the unauthorized or unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction or damage of the Customer Personal Data. Tallyfor does not agree to take on any higher level of security except by separate written agreement between you and the Chief Executive Officer of Tallyfor.</p>
            <p>14.3 Transfers outside of the EEA. We will not transfer Customer Personal Data outside the European Economic Area (and the United Kingdom if ever applicable) unless we have your written consent or there are appropriate safeguards in relation to the transfer and we are providing an adequate level of protection to any Customer Personal Data that is transferred.</p>
            <p>14.4 Data Breach. We will notify you without undue delay upon becoming aware of any Customer Personal Data breach affecting Customer Personal Data. You agree to assist us in responding to any request from a Data Subject and in ensuring compliance with its obligations under Data Legislation with respect to security, breach notifications, impact assessments and consultations with supervisory authorities or regulators.</p>
            <p>14.5 Records and Audit. We will maintain complete and accurate records and information to demonstrate our compliance with our promises herein and applicable law and will cooperate with and allow for audits by you or your designated auditor in relation to the operation of the Services on Customer Personal Data.</p>
            <p>14.5 Processors. In respect of Customer Personal Data originating from the European Economic Area, we agree not to use any third party processor (other than those set out in our privacy notice) without your prior written consent unless we have taken steps to ensure that the applicable terms with that processor will offer an equivalent level of protection for Customer Personal Data as those set out herein and which meet the requirements of article 28(3) of the GDPR of the European Economic Area. As between you and us we will remain fully liable for all acts or omissions of any third-party processor appointed by us in relation to such Customer Personal Data.</p>
            <p>14.6 Effect of Termination. We will delete or return all Customer Personal Data to you at the end of the relevant agreement between you and us if requested in writing. Otherwise we will retain Customer Personal Data in accordance with the retention periods set out in our privacy notice (EU addendum). We may retain Customer Personal Data if required by law only to the extent and for such period as required by those laws.</p>
            <h3><strong>15. Ending your relationship with Tallyfor</strong></h3>
            <p>15.1 The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Tallyfor as set out below.</p>
            <p>15.2 If you want to terminate your legal agreement with Tallyfor, you may do so by (a) notifying Tallyfor at any time using the method Tallyfor instructs you to use for this purpose and (b) closing your accounts for all of the Services which you use, where Tallyfor has made this option available to you.</p>
            <p>15.3 Tallyfor may at any time, terminate its legal agreement with you with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your account. Any fees paid hereunder are non-refundable.</p>
            <p>15.4 Nothing in this Section shall affect Tallyfor’s rights regarding provision of Services under Section 4 of the Terms.</p>
            <p>15.5 When these Terms come to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and liabilities that you and Tallyfor have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the Terms have been in force) or which are expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 20.1 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.</p>
            <h3><strong>16. Disclaimers</strong></h3>
            <p>16.1 The service is provided on an “as-is” and “as available” basis, and company (and our suppliers) expressly disclaim any and all warranties and conditions of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including all warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We (and our suppliers) make no warranty that the service will meet your requirements, will be available on an uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free basis, or will be accurate, reliable, free of viruses or other harmful code, complete, legal, or safe. If applicable law requires any warranties with respect to the service, all such warranties are limited in duration to ninety (90) days from the date of first use. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to you. In particular, our Services are only tools to assist you in conducting your tax preparation or other business. You remain entirely responsible to ensure your work is accurate and meets the standards set by you, your customers, and applicable law.</p>
            <h3><strong>17. EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES</strong></h3>

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR BREACH OF IMPLIED TERMS, OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

            <h3><strong>20. Terms and Termination</strong></h3>
            <p>20.1 Subject to this Section, these Terms will remain in full force and effect while you use the Service. We may suspend or terminate your rights to use the Service (including your Account) at any time for any reason at our sole discretion, including for any use of the Service in violation of these Terms.

            <h3><strong>21. Other content</strong></h3>

            <h3><strong>22. Changes to the Terms</strong></h3>
            <p>22.1 Tallyfor may make changes to the Universal Terms or Additional Terms from time to time. When these changes are made, Tallyfor will make a new copy of the Universal Terms available at <a href="https://tallyfor.com/terms">https://tallyfor.com/terms</a> and any new Additional Terms will be made available to you from within, or through, the affected Services.</p>
            <p>22.2 You understand and agree that if you use the Services after the date on which the Universal Terms or Additional Terms have changed, Tallyfor will treat your use as acceptance of the updated Universal Terms or Additional Terms.</p>
            <h3><strong>23. General legal terms</strong></h3>
            <p>23.1 Sometimes when you use the Services, you may (as a result of, or through your use of the Services) use a service or download a piece of software, or purchase goods, which are provided by another person or company. Your use of these other services, software or goods may be subject to separate terms between you and the company or person concerned. If so, the Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other companies or individuals.</p>
            <p>23.2 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Tallyfor and govern your use of the Services (but excluding any services which Tallyfor may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and Tallyfor in relation to the Services.</p>
            <p>23.3 You agree that Tallyfor may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, pop-ups or postings on the Services.</p>
            <p>23.4 You agree that if Tallyfor does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Tallyfor has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not constitute a formal waiver of Tallyfor’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Tallyfor. This includes Tallyfor later seeking to exercise or enforce such legal right or remedy. </p>
            <p>23.5 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms if such provision cannot be reformed to be both valid and consistent with its prior intent although now-circumscribed. The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable according to their terms.</p>
            <p>23.6 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Tallyfor is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms.</p>
            <p>23.7 No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this agreement or your use of the Services and you agree you do not have, and shall not represent you have, any authority of any kind to bind Tallyfor in any respect whatsoever as to any third party.</p>
            <p>23.8 The Terms, and your relationship with Tallyfor under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Tallyfor agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Tallyfor shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction and, where permitted to be contractually agreed in advance, without posting of any bond.</p>
